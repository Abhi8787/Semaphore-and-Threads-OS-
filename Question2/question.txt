Write a program to create two stacks of size 21. Create two threads running parallelly where
one thread will compute the average of the elements in first stack and the other will compute
median value of the elements in another stack. There will be one main thread which will wait
for the two parallel threads to complete their task and it will compute the differences of 
the two previously obtained output and print the final output.
